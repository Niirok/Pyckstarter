The purpose of this repo is to show what a python project shoul look like, with it's architecture and files. Python beginners should find here everything they need to start their on python project, like sources to basic package and writing convention. A few conventinal packages are needed, like pytest for testing and sphinx for documentation. Every package you need is environment.yml and you should only need a "conda env create -f environment.yml" to donwload them.

VariousSourcesOnPythonStuff is a file where I saved website I consulted for troublesoothing or gathering information on python. Feel free to add python learning web pages

Conventions.txt is a big plain text file where I put most of PEP8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and "The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python" (http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) guidelines. If you think that I missed something important, let me know

to run test, once pytest package is installed, use "pytest" command in root directory

to build documentation (don't forget to rtd theme) use "make html" in /docs

EVERYTHING MIGHT BE COUCHED IN BROKEN ENGLISH as it's not my mother tongue so let me know is you see something wrong or simply not english.
